# SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Analysis

This repository contains a statistical analysis of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion detection behavior among U.S. blood donors. The goal of this project was to support a CDC-affiliated research team by identifying demographic and behavioral factors that influence whether individuals self-report a swab during their seroconversion interval.

Using logistic regression models, we analyzed data from over 33,000 blood donors across subgroupsâ€”such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, geographic region, and vaccination statusâ€”to determine which factors significantly affect the odds of self-reporting. We also compared results between primary infection and reinfection cohorts.
